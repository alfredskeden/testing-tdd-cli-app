# testing-tdd-cli-app

### Questions:

1. Is i t ok to rewrite the tests after they are all green to refactor some stuff that you thought would be better in the long run?

2. I thought it was hard to figure out how to check for the errors in an CLI app. What are some of the good approaches here and why?

3. Differences between the equals in jest. Like `toStrictEqual` or `toEqual`: Answer use `toBe` if viable and then use what it wants you to use...

4. ~~Should I be also using the relevant types in the test or is that not an options since I still want it to look like that and even if its `any` does it matter or does it help? Then I would have to import the type?~~
